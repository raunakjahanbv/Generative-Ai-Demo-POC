Because All-Clad is unable to control the quality of All-Clad cookware products sold by unauthorized sellers, unless otherwise prohibited by law, this warranty does not cover All-Clad cookware products purchased from unauthorized retailers. \\n\\n        Should your All-Clad cookware require warranty service, please contact our Consumer Service Department by phone or website per below for a warranty evaluation and return authorization number. Upon approval of your claim, All-Clad will repair or replace the item without charge. If the replacement product is no longer in production, one of equal or greater value will be given. Under the terms of this warranty, All-Clad has no further obligations other than to repair or replace a defective product. All-Clad shall not be obliged to replace any product which is not accompanied by a valid proof of purchase from All-Clad or an All-Clad authorized retailer. \\n\\n        Exclusions:\\n\\n        This warranty does not cover: \\n\\n        Products purchased from unauthorized sellers. \\n        Damage arising from thermal shocks, drops, improper use, failure to follow the use and care instructions, or an unauthorized modification or repair. \\n        Normal product wear and tear. \\n        Discoloration, warping, or metal separation due to high heat or prolonged heat exposure when empty, or non-stick deterioration that occurs from misuse or abuse. \\n        Stains, discoloration, or scratches on the inside or outside of the product. \\n        Any accident caused by fire, flood, or similar catastrophic events. \\n        Commercial, professional, or workplace use. \\n        Any glass or porcelain in the product. \\n        Dust or insects inside the product. \\n        Nonstick damage caused by metal or sharp utensils. \\n        Damage caused by use of scouring pads, steel wool, abrasive cleaners, or bleach. \\n        Minor imperfections and color variations, which are normal. \\n        All-Clad warrants that nonstick coatings comply with regulations covering materials in contact with food. \\n\\n        There are no warranties which extend beyond those stated herein. Any implied warranties that may be applicable to All-Clad cookware products, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, are limited in duration to the duration of this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. \\n\\n        Under no circumstances shall All-Clad be liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages based upon breach of this limited warranty, breach of contract or strict liability. Some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. \\n\\n        Consumers’ Rights and additional information \\n\\n        This All-Clad warranty does not affect the statutory rights you may have or those rights that cannot be excluded or limited, nor rights against the retailer from which you purchased the product. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from State to State. The consumer may assert any such rights at his sole discretion. \\n\\n\\n        USA GROUPE SEB USA \\n\\n        2121 Eden Road \\n\\n        Millville, NJ 08332 \\n\\n        800-255-2523\\n\\n\\n        GROUPE SEB CANADA \\n\\n        36 Newmill Gate Unit 2 \\n\\n        Toronto, ON \\n\\n        M1V 0E2 \\n\\n        1-800-418-3325\\n\\n        www.all-clad.com / www.all-clad.ca\\n\\n        PRICE MATCH GUARANTEE:\\n\\n        Williams Sonoma Price Match Guarantee\\n\\n        At Williams Sonoma, we're committed to bringing you the best quality at the best prices.\\n" +
